Public health rests on the effectiveness of good policies and practices. These policies are built on solid evidence. This evidence can be generated through dutiful meticulous data collection (thank you health workers!) *and also* as a bi-product (thanks robots!) of useful tools helping health workers and public health practitioners do their day-to-day work. This is the ideal I'm trying to create. Busy professionals use digital tools that make their lives easier, which in turn do their recording and reporting for them making their lives even easier! There are indeed some reporting that simply must be deliberately done, but I believe the vast majority could be generated from the use of other tools.

In pursuing this ideal, I've developed and deployed five mobile apps with associated web apps, two other dedicated web apps and assisted with many others.
