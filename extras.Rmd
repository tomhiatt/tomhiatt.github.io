Here are some interesting things from my former life.
<br>

# Film

I created a feature-length student film as first assistant director with a great cast and crew. With a handsome cameo as well. Beautiful. Emotionally heavy, but beautiful.

# Church work

I served a two-year mission in the Philippines for my [church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist) at age 19. That's where I learned Tagalog.

I also served as the bishop (pastor) of our local congregation in Makati, Philippines. Wonderful people.

<br>

# Art

I received my undergraduate degree in visual art. Joined a student art show in Aukland, New Zealand. (Where did that sculpture end up?) Enjoyed a six-week field studies across New Zealand and Tonga.

<br>

# Performance

I performed improv comedy professionally (I guess as professional as it gets?) at [ComedySportz](https://www.comedysportzutah.com/). I even tried a bit of stand-up. Whew! 

<br>

# Shiny

Adapted a cool [math game](https://tomhiatt.shinyapps.io/math_game/) for my son.

Also made a [UN meeting cost calculator](https://tomhiatt.shinyapps.io/InternalMeetingCost/) for reasons completely unrelated to my opinion of how useful meetings are.
