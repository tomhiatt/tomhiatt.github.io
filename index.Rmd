I am an epidemiologist at the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/). I've been serving the member countries of WHO for over 14 years at the headquarters office in Geneva, Switzerland, as well as the Regional Office for the Western Pacific and the Philippines Country Office. I earned a masterâ€™s degree in epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine after completing my undergraduate work in art and film at Brigham Young University in the United States.

My work has covered a variety of areas in health. As part of the monitoring and evaluation team of the Global Tuberculosis Programme, I managed the data flow and analysis for five annual Global TB reports (even designing the cover art!) I have promoted digital solutions for health data management and collaboration for rabies, leprosy, health systems and health emergencies. I am passionate for making data actionable to improve health and save lives. 

I've lived in the Philippines for over ten years and speak fluent Tagalog. He currently resides in Laguna with his wife and six children.
